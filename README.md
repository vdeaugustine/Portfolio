## About Dialed In
This was my first iOS app I developed from scratch and published to the App Store. 

## Purpose
I developed this app because I love to golf. I believe it solves a proble mthat so many golfers face, regardless of skill level. Every golfer needs to know how far they hit their clubs. It is often not easy to know these numbers, espeically off the top of your head while you are on the course. 


## Technologies and Frameworks used in development
- **UIKit** and **Storyboard**
 are used for UI Design.
- **Codable, Encodable, Decodable,** and **Equatable** used for saving club distances and other persistence using **NSUserDefaults**.
- **CoreData** is used for saving and updating notes.
- **StoreKit** is used for in-app purchases.

## About Baseble
As Wordle took off in popularity, I noticed there was a demand for variations of it, and especially in the baseball fan community on Twitter and Reddit. I combined my love for baseball and iOS app development into a fun game that helped me learn about animations, JSON parsing, and using third party libraries with Swift Package Manager.
