## About **Dialed In Golf**
This was my first iOS app I developed from scratch and published to the App Store. 

## Purpose
I developed this app because I love to golf. I believe it solves a proble mthat so many golfers face, regardless of skill level. Every golfer needs to know how far they hit their clubs. It is often not easy to know these numbers, espeically off the top of your head while you are on the course. 


## Technologies and Frameworks used in development
- **UIKit** and **Storyboard**
 are used for UI Design.
- **Codable, Encodable, Decodable,** and **Equatable** used for saving club distances and other persistence using **NSUserDefaults**.
- **CoreData** is used for saving and updating notes.
- **StoreKit** is used for in-app purchases.
- **AVFoundation** is used for sound effects. 

## Challenges faced during development and lessons learned
- This app tought me about strategies to use while developing independently. 
- When I began, I had an idea in my head about what I wanted the app to do, but I wasn't sure how I was going to make it look. 
- There was a fair amount of trial and error when developing the UI and it progressed through different iterations. 
- I began using Storyboards to build the app but for some of the scenes I used

## About Baseble
As Wordle took off in popularity, I noticed there was a demand for variations of it, and especially in the sports fan community on Twitter and Reddit. I combined my love for baseball and iOS app development into a fun game that helped me learn about animations, JSON parsing, and using third party libraries with Swift Package Manager.

## SwiftUI Projects in Progress
### I love learning the latest technology. And right now one of the most exciting things in iOS development, I believe is SwiftUI. I love seeing the designs and experiences people in the iOS development community.

# School Projects 

## Piano Keys Imitation App

<p> This was one of the first apps I ever built. It was for a homework assingment for my iOS development class at CSUF. If you are not failiar with the Piano Keys app on the App Store, the goal is to tap only the black tiles as fast as you can. If you tap the white tiles, the game is over. The app saves the user's high score in NSUserDefaults.

## Golf

I started golfing casually in high school. But I started taking it much more seriously at the beginning of 2021. My average score is usually somewhere around +10 to +12
I'm always excited for a round of golf and it has lead me to ideas for several apps, one of which led to the development of Dialed In Golf.
